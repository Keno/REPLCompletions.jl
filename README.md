REPLCompletions.jl
==================

Tab completion for your Julia REPL.

# Possible completions
## Julia
- [x] Names of variables and functions defined or imported to the global scope.
- [ ] Names of variables and functions defined in the current cell/string.
- [ ] Methods of a function if inside a function call.
- [ ] Importable modules after `using \t`
- [ ] Help for function if pos is at the beginning of a function call
- [ ] Autocomplete fields of composite types after `.` wherever possible.

## Shell
- [x] Accessible command line programs
- [ ] Arguments for common programs (like git pull, push, commit, checkout)

# The interface

The interface is very simple. There are two exported methods provided:

```julia
	completions(string,pos)
	shell_completions(string,pos)
```

The former provides completion of julia expression while the latter provides completion 
of julia shell syntax (`;` at the standard REPL or inside backticks).

Both functions have the same return format:

```julia
	results, range = completions(string,pos)
```

The first return value is an array of possible completions, while the second return value 
is a range specifying the part of the string that was matched. In particular this means
that to execute a completion, you should replace `string[range]` by `completion[i]` for some `i`.
